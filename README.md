Chrome Extension to block Islamophobic websites
This Chrome Extension gives you the opportunity to block harmful websites when you come across them at your choosing.
Also comes prepackaged with a list of known Islamophobic websites that users will never see.
Just added functionality to leverage the openai module to analyze websites on the fly and add them to the "blocked" list if found to be harmful.
Note: This project was initially targeted to combat Islamophobia, but can easily be expanded to other forms of Hate Speech.
